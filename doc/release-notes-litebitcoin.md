How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the 
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Litebitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `litebitcoind`/`litebitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

The first time you run version 4.0.0.0 or higher, your chainstate database will
be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to
half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.

If you a pool after upgrade you need make setting to choise after 68000 block algo from scrypt to neoscrypt, ot change it manual when prefork block be mined.
